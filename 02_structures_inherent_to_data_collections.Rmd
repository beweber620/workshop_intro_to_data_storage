> All Data Has a Structure Inherent to Itself

Data is seldom collected, presented, or used in research in a vacuum. Researchers have reasons why they collect data, people have reasons why post information on Social Media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and TickTock, and digital content publishers and platforms have structures that limit both the types of data that appear and how different, discrete information elements relate to each other on these platforms.
