## Overview

This reader serves as a reference work for the UC Davis DataLab introductory workshop on databases and other data storage technologies.  The workshop provides a broad overview of the various technologies for storing and organizing different collections of data. Topics covered include: how data structure impacts your storage options; how your research questions could impact your storage options; and guideles on which platforms you might consider for your research based on the previous two considerations. This workshop is a general lecture with Q&A (no laptops necessary) and is a prerequisite for DataLab’s “Getting started with SQL for querying databases” workshop.

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this workshop, learners should be able to:

– compare and contrast different data storage platforms;

– explain the differences between SQL and noSQL databases;

– explain the components of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD);

– define relational keys;

– identify appropriate data storage solutions based on the structure of a research dataset and anticipated research questions.

## Prerequisites

NONE.  This workshops assumes no prior knowledge or experience working with databases or other data storage technologies nor any coding and/or scripting knowledge or experience.
